    -Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world. 
   
    -Abstraction is used to describe things in simple terms. 
    
    -It's used to create a boundary between the application and the client programs.

    -Objects are the building blocks of Object-Oriented Programming. An object contains some properties and methods. 
    
    - We can hide them from the outer world through access modifiers. We can provide access only for required functions and properties to the other programs.

    types of abstraction -:

     Data Abstraction
            When the object data is not visible to the outer world, it creates data abstraction. If needed, access to the Objects’ data is provided through some methods.

    Process Abstraction
            We don’t need to pr details about all the functions of an object. When we hide the internal implementation of the different functions involved in a user operation, it creates process abstraction.
