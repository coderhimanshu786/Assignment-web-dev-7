    A constructor is a special function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class. In JavaScript, a constructor gets called when an object is created using the new keyword. The purpose of a constructor is to create a new object and set values for any existing object properties.

    for example-:

                        //Constructor
                            function User() {
                                this.name = 'Bob';
                            }

                            var user = new User();
