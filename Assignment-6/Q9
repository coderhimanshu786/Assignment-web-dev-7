    Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes. For more examples and explanations, see the Using classes guide.

    for example

                                            // Declaration
                                        class Rectangle {
                                          constructor(height, width) {
                                            this.height = height;
                                            this.width = width;
                                          }
                                        }
                                        
                                        // Expression; the class is anonymous but assigned to a variable
                                        const Rectangle = class {
                                          constructor(height, width) {
                                            this.height = height;
                                            this.width = width;
                                          }
                                        };
                                        
                                        // Expression; the class has its own name
                                        const Rectangle = class Rectangle2 {
                                          constructor(height, width) {
                                            this.height = height;
                                            this.width = width;
                                          }
                                        };
