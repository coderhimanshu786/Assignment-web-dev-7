Ans-2
    “this” keyword refers to an object that is executing the current piece of code. It references the object that is executing the current function. If the function being referenced is a regular function, “this” references the global object.
    Or
    The this keyword represents a JavaScript object in the global scope or inside a function scope and its value depends on how you call the function, not, how you define it. Therefore, this value inside a function is not guaranteed to be the same as it depends on the function call signature.

    for example-
                            const person = {
                                firstName: "John",
                                lastName : "Doe",
                                id       : 5566,
                                fullName : function() {
                                    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
                                }
                                };

                                */
